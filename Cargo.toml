# This is a temporary fix until we stop to use zexe; it's needed to replace
# in the dependency graph the library below with the revision specified.
# Unfortunately `patch` works matching just the URL - doesn't take in account
# revision or branches, see:  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5478
#
# A quick workaround is changing the URL with double slashes
